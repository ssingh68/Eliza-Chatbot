# Eliza-Chatbot

### Description

We started by importing the regular expression(re), random, datetime and time library. Then we added the dictionary for most used nouns(Noun_reflections) and pronouns (Pronoun_reflections) which would help us in word spotting from the questions and transform it according to the answers.Then we added the Expressions as in Regular Expressions - using the re library to match the questions or statements given by user as input and then some random answers(using the random library)

### What our Chatbot can do?

We have tried to implement the chatbot using pattern matching techniques - 
Regular Expressions or Regexes which allows the chatbot to converse with a human by following the rules and directions of the script. This chatbot, in specific, can engage in a conversation based on certain patterns. Although this chatbot does not explictly recognize complex word mathcing, minimal context it attempts to present itself in a humane manner since only regexes were used.
